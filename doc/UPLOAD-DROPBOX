1) Get the current repo:

$ git clone https://github.com/ileiva/gettor.git

2) Check if you have Dropbox and GnuPG Python modules. If not, install them:

$ pip install dropbox gnupg

4) Get the PGP key that signs the Tor Browser Bundles.

3) Change general configuration and account info in dropbox.cfg.

3) Run the script:

$ python dropbox.py

If everything works fine, you should see a dropbox.links file inside the
'providers' directory. The script will take the files on upload_dir
(dropbox.cfg) that end up on .xz and .xz.asc respectively. A script for
getting the latest bundles from dist.tp.o is pending.
